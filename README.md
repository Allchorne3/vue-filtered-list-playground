### How to get started

There are two ways that you can use this template. 

* **Option 1:** Click the green `Use this template` button near the top of this page, then click `Create a new respository`

* **Option 2:** Click the green `Code` button, make sure you are on the `local` tab and then click `Download ZIP`. Once it has downloaded, unzip the file and copy it to your preferred destination.

_Once you have selected option 1 or 2, you can then do the following:_

1. Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for short)

2. Once completed, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can view this on your browser by going to `localhost:8080` _OR_ for a production build, run `npm run build`. _You will know this has worked because youâ€™ll see a folder called public_
